        sub_heading:"Bamako (ICRC) – The suffering of millions of people in Mali and the wider Sahel region is rooted in the deadly combination of conflict and the climate crisis. Caught between advancing deserts, erratic weather and violence, entire communities are being forced to leave their homes, livestock and livelihoods behind.",
        heading:"Climate change, conflict force communities in the Sahel region into desperate state",
        content:"During her first operational visit as president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric warned that pressure is rising in the Sahel on both those who have been displaced and the host communities sharing their water, food and land. This pressure must be mitigated so that resentment doesn’t build and fracture links between communities. “These families are desperate for a better way of life. I sat with women who had to bury their children as they were fleeing their village. Many lost husbands and brothers. Humanitarian assistance is limited, and they don’t see a way out. We have to break this vicious circle of climate change and violence that is preventing people from living on their lands,” Ms Spoljaric said. Bintou, a mother of 10 whose husband died of thirst as the family fled their village, lives in a simple, makeshift camp outside Gao with five of her children; the other five are dispersed around the region. We haven’t known peace since the crisis of 2012,” Bintou said. “After recent deadly attacks we were forced to flee our village. Armed fighters killed all the men, our husbands, our sons, and our girls, and raped some of the women. Violence has forced 4.5 million out of their homes in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, a 200% increase in the past two years. With 80% of the population of the Sahel relying on agriculture to survive, being displaced means they lose access to their lands and their livestock. Climate change is a daily reality for Mali. Entire lakes, such as Lake Faguibine, have dried up, erasing entire ecosystems and forcing communities to move. Desertification is spreading and ground water is becoming increasingly scarce, pressuring farmers. Mali lost 90,000 hectares of yield in 2021 due to drought, impacting the livelihood of more than 3 million Malians. This resulted in a 10.5% decrease in cereal production across the country. The Mali Red Cross, whose volunteers are on the ground every day with communities across the country, is at the core of humanitarian work in Mali. The volunteers’ motivation, dedication and contribution cannot be overstated. But the challenges remain immense. “At a time of global instability and rising humanitarian challenges, we must ensure that countries in the Sahel are not forgotten,” Ms Spoljaric said. “While responding to ongoing emergencies is critical, targeted investments are needed to help people adapt to rapid changes caused by climate change and break their dependence on aid.”",

        content:"Land “plays a key role in the climate system” as an essential carbon sink because its surfaces, such as forests, regulate the planet’s temperature and help to store carbon. In the last decade alone, land-based ecosystems absorbed around 30 per cent of the carbon emissions generated by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels. But our land is under increasing pressure from deforestation, urbanization, industrial development, agricultural expansion and unsustainable farming practices that are undermining its ability to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, as well as regulate the climate and air quality. And a changing climate, in turn, exacerbates land degradation through drought, desertification and other extreme weather events that are increasing in frequency and intensity as the planet gets warmer. Socio-economic gains of land restoration The economic gains from land restoration, including its impact on emission cuts and the prevention of biodiversity loss, could be significant, amounting to up to $140 trillion per year — which is 50 per cent more than the global GDP in 2021. If we used just $1.6 trillion of the annual amount of $700 billion spent on subsidies for the fossil fuel and agricultural industries over the next ten years, countries would be able to restore some 1 billion degraded hectares of land — an area the size of the United States or China, including 250 million hectares of farmland. Land also has a great potential to provide renewable energy — through bioenergy which is produced from a variety of organic materials such as plant and animal matter. Today, bioenergy is one of the largest sources of renewable energy globally, accounting for 55 per cent of renewable energy and over 6 per cent of global energy supply. It is also an important source of employment, particularly in rural areas. The biofuels sector provides more than 2 million jobs globally and is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. However, high dependence on biomass, even with the development of improved equipment, can contribute to deforestation, degradation of soil quality and reduced biodiversity. Visit the UN Environment Programme and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) websites for more information about the impact of land degradation and the importance of restoration.",
